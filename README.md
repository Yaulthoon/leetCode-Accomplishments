# leetCode Accomplishments

Since I started working on leetCode to practice algorithms, I've decided to create a repository for some of my more successful submissions.  All of the code here will be original.  Hopefully this list will grow over time as I improve my skills.

### Current Submissions in this repository:

4). Median of Two Sorted Arrays.  Runtime: 108 ms, faster than 80.42% of JavaScript online submissions.

8). String to Integer (atoi).  Runtime: 72 ms, faster than 98.48% of JavaScript online submissions.

11). Container With Most Water.  Runtime: 56 ms, faster than 100.00% of JavaScript online submissions.

151). Reverse Words in a String.  Runtime 52ms.  faster than 99.74% of JavaScript submissions.

152). Maximum Product Subarray.  Runtime: 60 ms, faster than 74.19% of JavaScript submissions.

### Restructured from previous existing solution (not original)

5). Longest Palindromic Substring
